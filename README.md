Basic Backbone js example without Routing
===============================

OUTSTANDING TASKS
1. Add sinon.js to the mix for mocking
2. Write full test coverage for all elements of the application
3. Sort out the css and fonts
4. Decide on CSS framework to use and % vs em vs px (preferably compass css)
5. Backbone Routing could be added but not essential;


Tests Structure already exists in tests folder - just run index.html

CONSIDERATIONS:

The code should be run in a browser that allows cross domain ajax (or open file policy) - disabled on Chrome by default,
but should work on Firefox (default enabled)
